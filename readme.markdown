OSG Monitoring Android Application
==================================

Overview
--------
The android application is also on the market as OSG.  
[The direct link](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.osg.osgmon)

The application shows a map of OSG sites, as well as current monitoring of the
sites.


To Develop
----------
I always accept patches or suggestions/issues.

I use Eclipse for development.  To import the project, download from github:
    git clone https://djw8605@github.com/djw8605/OSG-Android.git

You also need the dependency library [android-mapviewballoons](https://github.com/jgilfelt/android-mapviewballoons).  
It's available on github as well.

Import the mapviewballoons in as an android library.  Documentation is 
available from the [android docs](http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/projects/projects-eclipse.html).
